 The-sad-truth

All my life ive been pretending to be some online addicted loser to get people of my back and escape the horrible reality... 

ive been pretending so much i almost fergot who i am myself...

i am NOT a person who wants to be on hes pc all day i just really dont have a choice

i live in a fuckass city in belguim where the only "jobs" i can do is slaving away in some stuipid store

every other options requires me to take a train or some shit and guess what u need money for that... but guess what u need a fucking job for that. 

anyways since i dont want to slave away in stores 30 years of my life just to start living when im about 50 and fucking basicly dead...

so ive just been sitting online acting like everything is fine but the last few months ive been thinking more about how fake my life has become...

i dont have irl friends.
my own fucking family doesnt know me
the only people that know me a bit are people i havent even seen irl... 

if that isnt sad then no idea what is...

anyways my life is basicly fucked is what im implying...

so i prob wont be here long anymore...

i cant really thank anyone since this is on the internet and i cant give names for obvious reasons...

but there is like 3 people in my life that actually made me feel happy

all i really want is to be in peace chilling...

if i could i would be living on some kind of farm caring for my animals

but i dont and never will have the funds for that even if i would get a job and work my ass off

i really spend 20 years being someone thats not even me...

its not like i had a choice in the first place...

everything i say gets ignored or is wrong...
i might have autism but come on...
the core issue is that i live with my mother she acts like she cares about me but i dont belive it...
i can say anything but it gets ignored once anyone says anything else.
if i would say i like dinos and some random ass child she has never seen before would say "no he likes trains" she would belive the stuipid child over me... 

weird ass example i know but i cant think rn or it gets worse

i never understood why she thinks i dont know what im doing...

she or anyone at this point was right instead me even tho im the one that knows what i do and what i want

so if i suddenly dont go online anymore dont worry im in a better place...
